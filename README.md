## Simple ToDo App Demo!

### Initial requirements: 

>1. First screen needs to have welcome message, language selection and username. After filling up all fields from first screen you must go to second (First screen is called only first time when app is loaded). 
>2. Second screen includes list with tasks with possibilities "Add, Remove and Edit". 
>3. Third screen includes list with already "Complete" to-do's. Bonus task: You can select image/avatar for each To-do list.

### Notes: 
- Language change is supported for ALL texts, but is only switchable in the initial screen. This was purpousefully done so due to the requirements and could easily be implemented to switch it at any screen. 
- Navigation headers were also purposefully removed to fit the requirements and only show the initial screen on startup.
